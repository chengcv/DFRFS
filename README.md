# Disentangled Feature Representation For Few-Shot Learning

## Code will be released soon after review.

## FS-DomainNet

DomainNet dataset is proposed for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation in the [paper](http://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/#code), and can be downloaded from the following link: http://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/

We reorganize it for few-shot learning and select 299 categories with 527156 images that include at least the number of samples (i.e., 20) required by the 5-shot setting on each domain.

Then we split 299 categories into 191, 47 and 61 for training, validation and testing, respectively, while maintaining the consistency of class split on each domain.

Data Split is available on BaiduYun [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AL3EcAbUXDsEu4VQ2_AIWA) with the extra code vrfx, and GoogleDrive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H3PsLXR6sJK6dKTIOpP3qznsypAQ4Ix6/view?usp=sharing).
